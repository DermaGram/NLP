1. Add PDF to github called "Project Details"
~~2. Add input and output directories~~
~~3. Once you calculate params for multiple languages, store those values somewhere so that you can use them to infer an unseen language pair~~
~~4. Upload the results and images/links of the graphs for english/chinese that you ran~~
~~5. Add the arguments for --param and --infer as well as --plot~~
~~6. Write code to actually infer a language based on the params~~
8. Add ideas for how this program may be improved
- c++ implementation
~~- batch processing w/ multi threading~~
~~9. Add timer to your code running so that you can analyze performance improvements~~
~~10. write time to process to the output file~~
~~11. Make it clearer what's happening when no grouping is provided (why 1M?)~~
~~* example, write "ALL" for when there is no grouping~~
~~12. Fix clock time, it's writing a negative time...~~
~~13. Include name of file to which results are written for params and inference~~
~~14. Make groups an option ONLY for '--param'. Right now, you can call it when you specify '--infer'~~
~~15. Should you write the parameters AND the inferences when '--infer' is called?~~
16. explain what files mean 500 = # lines, and ordering of source vs target zh-en.zh
17. recalculate params, but now for 100l
